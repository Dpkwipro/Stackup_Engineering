### 📚 Detailed setup guides

For first-time setup, follow the master guide:

→ **[docs/setup/SETUP_GUIDE.md](docs/setup/SETUP_GUIDE.md)**

---

### Quick start (after prerequisites installed)

Below steps are mentioned in detail in SETUP_GUIDE.md hence follow from their to avoid any errors.
Once python venv setup with all the requirment.txt package are done you can start the docker service as mentioned in below step 4 . After that you can start with every pillar one by one.

```bash

# 1. Set up Python environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # Mac/Linux
# OR: venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Start Docker services
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Start with Pillar 1
cat tasks/01_foundations/INSTRUCTIONS.md
```

## 🎯 Assessment Tasks Overview

1. Each pillar has detailed instructions in its respective `INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
2. Refer to `starter_files` to see how to create the solutions for every section mentioned in `INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

   > **Note:** Do not write your code in these `starter_files`. They are for read-only purposes. All your solutions should be added to the `solutions` folder.

3. All the solutions for every section should be added to the `solutions` folder using the folder structure below:

   ```
   solutions/submissions/<trainee_name>/01_foundations/<python_file.py> or <sql_file.sql>
   solutions/submissions/<trainee_name>/02_sql_and_viz/<python_file.py> or <sql_file.sql>
   solutions/submissions/<trainee_name>/03_big_data/<python_file.py> or <sql_file.sql>
   solutions/submissions/<trainee_name>/04_infrastructure/<python_file.py> or <sql_file.sql>
   ```

4. All output generated as part of your solutions should be placed using the folder structure below:

   ```
   outputs/results/<trainee_name>/01_foundations/<output_files/diagrams/etc>
   outputs/results/<trainee_name>/02_sql_and_viz/<output_files/diagrams/etc>
   outputs/results/<trainee_name>/03_big_data/<output_files/diagrams/etc>
   outputs/results/<trainee_name>/04_infrastructure/<output_files/diagrams/etc>
   ```

Note: you can refer below commands to run Airflow dag:

step 1:

docker exec -it <airflow-container-name> bash
cd /opt/airflow/dags
rm airflow_dag_starter.py
rm -rf /opt/airflow/dags/__pycache__
exit
docker compose restart

Open UI 
http://localhost:8081 --- credential to logon are shared in setup guide.

*** by the end of above steps you would be able to see airflow UI.

step 2:
docker exec -it airflow-webserver bash
***now you are into airflow container
*** copy your dag file or use below command:
cat <<EOF > /opt/airflow/dags/presight_etl_pipeline.py
<SOLUTION>
EOF

exit

docker compose restart

***Open UI 
http://localhost:8081 --- credential to logon are shared in setup guide.
